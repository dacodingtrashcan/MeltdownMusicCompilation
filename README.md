# Have you ever felt that only one dynamic meltdown track was not enough?
### Well then this is the mod for you!

This mod adds as of now 4 different dynamic meltdown tracks that randomly play whenever the apparatus is removed, with more planned.

(What i mean by dynamic is that the mod uses lethal resonance meltdown for the alarms and stuff)

PLEASE NOTE: THIS MOD USES PIZZAPROBABILITY FOR MORE COMPAT WITH PIZZATOWERESCAPEMUSIC AND FACILITY MELTDOWN. PIZZAPROBABILTY ALSO ADDS A CHANCE FOR THE MELTDOWN INSTEAD OF IT ALWAYS HAPPENING. TO MAKE IT ALWAYS HAPPEN, YOU WILL NEED TO SET THE GLOBAL MELTDOWN CHANCE VALUE OF PIZZAPROBABILITIES CONFIG TO 100.

I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THESE TRACKS/SOUNDS, THEY ARE NOT MINE.
ALL OWNERSHIP OF THE TRACKS/SOUNDS IN THIS MOD GOES TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS.
